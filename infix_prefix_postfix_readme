// Infix, prefix, postfix
Binary operator: An operator that requires exactly two operands eg: a + b , here a,b are operands + is operator 
For multiple operators, we need to follow some rules to evaluate expression
Order of operation
------------------
1) parenthesis: () {} []
2) Exponents: 2^3^2 - order: right to left 
3) Multiplication and division - Order: left to right
4) Addition and substraction - order: left to right
eg: 2*6/2-3+7 -> here * and / will occupy same precedence so evaulate from left
=> 12/2-3+7 => 6-3+7 => 3+7 = 10
